# qwopper_bopper
A 2-player fighting game with unnecessarily difficult controls, under construction.

I wouldn't call it _fun_ yet, but it is funny for a few minutes :)


## Controls
- Q: open thighs
- W: close thighs
- O: open calves
- P: close calves
- E: open arms
- R: close arms

## Implementation

Python `pymunk` as the physics engine, communicating with a simple JS canvas animation loop over websockets.
